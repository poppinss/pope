Pope is a fast, minimal and micro template engine for strings only, it plays well where you want to embed micro templates inside your module.

## Examples

### string interpolation
```javascript
const pope = require('pope')
pope('There are {{count}} emails in your inbox', {count:20})
```

### nested values

```javascript
const pope = require('pope')
pope('My name is {{profile.name}} and age is {{profile.age}}', {profile: {name:'virk', age: 26}})
```

### arrays only

```javascript
const pope = require('pope')
pope('There are {{0}} emails in your inbox', [20])
```

### prop

If you wish to retrieve values from a nested data structure without interpolating into a string, you can make use of `prop`. Note the missing `{{}}`.

```javascript
const pope = require('pope')
pope.prop('count',{count:20}) // 20
pope.prop('profile.name',{profile: {name:'virk', age: 26}}) // virk
pope.prop('0', [20]) // 20
pope.prop('profile.validate',{profile: {name:'virk', validate: /^[A-Z][a-z]+/}}) //   /^[A-Z][a-z]+/
```

## Options

You can also pass an options object to define the interpolation behavior.

#### skipUndefined
Do not replace the undefined values with an empty string.

```javascript
const pope = require('pope')
pope('There are {{0}} emails in your inbox', {}, {
  skipUndefined: true
})
// returns - There are {{0}} emails in your inbox
```

#### throwOnUndefined
Throw exception when a undefined value is found. `throwOnUndefined` gets priority over `skipUndefined` if both are defined.

```javascript
const pope = require('pope')
pope('Hello {{ username }}', {}, {
  throwOnUndefined: true
})

// throws exception
```

```js
{ 
  message: 'Missing value for {{ username }}',
  key: 'username',
  code: 'E_MISSING_KEY',
  stack: '.....'
}
```
